**nsfw-index** is an open-source metadata indexing service. We aggregate, normalize, and index metadata from major platforms to provide developers, researchers, and analysts with free, ready-to-use data and a unified query interface.

> [!WARNING]
> This documentation, datasets, and API are related to **adult-oriented platforms and materials**.
>
> The service **does not host, store, or distribute any adult content**. Only **publicly available metadata** (such as titles, descriptions, tags, and technical attributes) is collected and indexed.
>
> This project is intended for **legal adults only** and for professional development, research, or analytical purposes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This repository contains scrapers source code.**
>
> *   **If you want to use the data:** You probably don't need to run this code. Please wait for the public API or database release.
> *   **If you want to contribute:** You are in the right place!
